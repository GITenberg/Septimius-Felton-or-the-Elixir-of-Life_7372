description: One of Nathaniel Hawthorne's later works, Septimius Felton is a beguiling
  and thought-provoking tale of murder most foul. One of a series of the author's
  works that grapple with themes of immortality, Septimius Felton was written shortly
  before Hawthorne himself succumbed to a mysterious illness, a fact that lends a
  dimension of profound poignancy to the story.
